Welcome to Geotessera!  This is a CLI interface to the Tessera foundation
model, which gives access to geospatial embeddings that have processed
Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to generate 128-channel
representation maps at 10m resolution.

These embeddings compress a full year of temporal-spectral features into dense
representations optimized for downstream geospatial analysis tasks.

Here's how to take it for a spin using the Geotessera CLI...
